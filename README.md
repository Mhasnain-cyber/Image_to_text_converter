# Image_to_text_converter
 This script (run_ocr.py) is a GUI-based Handwritten Digit Recognition application using a trained OCR model. It allows users to select an image containing a handwritten digit, preprocesses the image, and predicts the digit using a TensorFlow/Keras model. The interface is built using Tkinter, and image processing is handled with OpenCV and PIL.
